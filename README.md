## Running OpenSearch with etcd cluster state

Within this branch, I'm updating the README to explain how to get started with etcd.

### Install and launch etcd

See instructions at https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/.

On my Mac, this meant `brew install etcd`. Then I just ran the `etcd` executable and left it running in a terminal tab.

On Ubuntu, I needed to run `sudo apt install etcd-server etcd-client` to get both the `etcd` and `etcdctl` commands. Installing the server automatically started the `etcd` process.

You should also get the `etcdctl` command line tool included. You can interact with the running local etcd instance as follows:

```bash
# Write value 'bar' to key 'foo'
% etcdctl put foo bar
OK

# Read the value from key 'foo'
% etcdctl get foo
foo
bar

# Get all keys whose first byte is between ' ' (the earliest printable character) and '~' (the last)
%  etcdctl get ' ' '~'
foo
bar

# Delete the entry for key 'foo'
% etcdctl del foo
1
```

### Run three OpenSearch nodes from this branch

In order to validate that we can form a working distributed system without a cluster, we will start three OpenSearch nodes
locally. The first will serve as a coordinator, while the other two will be data nodes

```bash
# Clone the repo
% git clone https://github.com/msfroh/OpenSearch.git

# Enter the cloned repo
% cd OpenSearch

# Checkout the correct branch
% git checkout clusterless_datanode

# Run with the cluster-etcd plugin loaded and launch three nodes. We also need to set the clusterless mode feature flag.
% ./gradlew run -PinstalledPlugins="['cluster-etcd']" -PnumNodes=3 -Dtests.opensearch.opensearch.experimental.feature.clusterless.enabled=true

# In another tab, check the local cluster state for each node

# In the examples below, this will be the coordinator node. Note that the node name is runTask-0.
% curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state?local&pretty'

# In the examples below, this will be the first data node. Note that the node name is runTask-1.
% curl 'http://localhost:9201/_cluster/state?local&pretty'

# In the examples below, this will be the second data node. Note that the node name is runTask-2.
% curl 'http://localhost:9202/_cluster/state?local&pretty'
```

### Push some state to etcd to start the data nodes

The cluster-etcd plugin now uses a split metadata approach that separates index configuration into distinct etcd keys:

- **Settings**: `/indices/{index}/settings` - Basic index configuration needed by all nodes
- **Mappings**: `/indices/{index}/mappings` - Field definitions needed primarily by data nodes

This approach reduces etcd storage requirements and simplifies control plane logic by filtering out data plane implementation details.

```bash
# Write index settings and mappings separately (new split metadata approach)
# Settings are needed by both data nodes and coordinators
% cat << EOF | etcdctl put runTask/indices/myindex/settings
{
  "index": {
    "number_of_shards": "1",
    "number_of_replicas": "0",
    "uuid": "E8F2-ebqQ1-U4SL6NoPEyw",
    "version": {
      "created": "137227827"
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Mappings are needed by data nodes only (flattened structure)
% cat << EOF | etcdctl put runTask/indices/myindex/mappings
{
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "text",
      "fields": {
        "keyword": {
          "type": "keyword",
          "ignore_above": 256
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Assign primary for shard 0 of myindex to the node listening on port 9201/9301
% etcdctl put runTask/search-unit/runTask-1/goal-state '{"local_shards":{"myindex":{"0":"PRIMARY"}}}'

# Assign primary for shard 1 of myindex to the node listening on port 9202/9302
% etcdctl put runTask/search-unit/runTask-2/goal-state '{"local_shards":{"myindex":{"1":"PRIMARY"}}}'

# Verify the split metadata was stored correctly
% etcdctl get "runTask/indices/myindex/settings"
% etcdctl get "runTask/indices/myindex/mappings"

# Check all keys to see the new structure
% etcdctl get "" --from-key --keys-only

# Check the local cluster state on each data node
% curl 'http://localhost:9201/_cluster/state?local&pretty'
% curl 'http://localhost:9202/_cluster/state?local&pretty'

# Write a document to each shard. Here we're relying on knowing which shard each doc will land on (from trial and error).
# Note that if you try sending each document to the other data node, it will fail, since the data nodes don't know about
# each other and don't know where to forward the documents.
% curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:9201/myindex/_doc/3 -d '{"title":"Hello from shard 0"}'
% curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:9202/myindex/_doc/1 -d '{"title":"Hello from shard 1"}'

# Search the document on shard 0
% curl 'http://localhost:9201/myindex/_search?pretty'

# Search the document on shard 1
% curl 'http://localhost:9202/myindex/_search?pretty'
```

### Add a coordinator

The coordinator automatically resolves node names to node IDs by reading health data, eliminating the need to manually extract node IDs and ephemeral IDs.

```bash
# Tell the coordinator about the data nodes using their node names (not IDs).
% cat << EOF | etcdctl put runTask/search-unit/runTask-0/goal-state
{
  "remote_shards": {
    "indices": {
      "myindex": {
        "uuid" : "E8F2-ebqQ1-U4SL6NoPEyw",
        "shard_routing" : [
          [
            {"node_name": "runTask-1", "primary": true }
          ],
          [
            {"node_name": "runTask-2", "primary": true }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Search via the coordinator node. You'll see both documents added above
% curl 'http://localhost:9200/myindex/_search?pretty'

# Index a batch of documents (surely hitting both shards) via the coordinator node
% curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:9200/myindex/_bulk -d '
{ "index": {"_id":"2"}}
{"title": "Document 2"}
{ "index": {"_id":"4"}}
{"title": "Document 4"}
{ "index": {"_id":"5"}}
{"title": "Document 5"}
{ "index": {"_id":"6"}}
{"title": "Document 6"}
{ "index": {"_id":"7"}}
{"title": "Document 7"}
{ "index": {"_id":"8"}}
{"title": "Document 8"}
{ "index": {"_id":"9"}}
{"title": "Document 9"}
{ "index": {"_id":"10"}}
{"title": "Document 10"}
'

# Search via the coordinator node. You'll see 10 documents. If you search each data node you'll see around half.
% curl 'http://localhost:9200/myindex/_search?pretty'
```

### Heartbeat and Health Data

Nodes automatically publish health and status information to ETCD at the path `{cluster_name}/search-unit/{node_name}/actual-state`.

```bash
# View heartbeat data for all nodes
% etcdctl get "runTask/search-unit/" --prefix

# View specific node's health data
% etcdctl get "runTask/search-unit/<nodename>/actual-state"
```
